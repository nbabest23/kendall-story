   <h1>Darnell's Road To Victory</h1>
   <h2>by: Immanuel Best </h2>
    
    <p>
        Darnell Walker is at the free throw line. They are down by 1 98-97 with 12 seconds left on the shot clock. Its the 4th quarter. Darnell shoots the first free throw and the crowd is silent as ever. You could hear a pen if it dropped that's how quiet it was. He makes the first free throw all net. The crowd goes bananas. He walks away from the free throw line with belief takes a deep breath and walks back to the line. He signals his bigmen to get ready to boix out hard for the rebound just incase he misses. Darnell shoots the second free throw. It bounces off the front of the rim, bounces again and makes it. Everyone is screaming and hype of emotion, however Darnell doesn't have a smile on his face nor a reaction. He knows they could still lose so he is focused as ever. Timeout was called by Coach Dawkins from Valley Stream.
