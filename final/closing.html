   <h1>Darnell's Road To Victory </h1>
     <h2>by: Immanuel Best </h2>
    <p>
        The Vikings and the Sharks are ready fro the finals possession. Darnell is focused as ever. He walks up to Trayvon and stares at him. As he staring Trayvon says "good luck guarding me bro, you're gonna need it". Darnell then laughs and puts his game fgace back on. The ref blows the whistle and the game is on. The sharks inbounds the ball. They give it to Trayvon. Therer is 12 seconds left. Trayvon makes a quick crossover going to the right and darnell beats him to the spot. He goes behind the back and drives left, but Darnell once again beats him to the spot. There isnt't anywhere to go for Trayvon because Darnell is playing good defense. Trayvon then pulls his trump card. He likes to isolate his defender 1 on 1 a lot in games. But when he can't get passed the defender he calls for a pick from his teammates. So his center set the screen darnell gets hit with the screen. However, when he gets around the screen he swipes the ball and tips it from Trayvon. Trayvon wobbles the ball but finally catches it. Now there is one 2 seconds left on the clock. With no time to fully catch the ball and gather to shoot, Trayvon throws upa wild layup but it looks on target, but then Darnell's teammate Lonnie Baker Jumps as high as he can and blocks Trayvon Laup and time expires. The Crowd goes nuts screaming as Trayvon and Lonnie make huge defensive clutcdh plays to end the game! Trayvon crying tears of joy as this was his last highschool game and is heading off college to play D1 NCAA Basketball. Trayvon and his team are highschool champions for the first time in school history. And he now takes home not only the championship trophy, he is names PSAL AAA Finals MVP.    </p>
