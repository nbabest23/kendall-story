        Timeout was called and the Viking are up by 1 with 12 seconds left. Coach Ellis is talking to his players with energy and aggression. "Its the final game guys. Just one more stop and we are city champions. If we don't stop them dont worry we have one more timeout left. Stick to your defensive assignments and we will win", said Coach Ellis. Darnell had an idea. "Hey, coach let me guard Trayvon", said Darnell. Coach replied "Are you sure? Jacob has been doing a good job on him when you were on the bench early in the 4th". Darnell then says "Yes, I got him. I will force a stop. He's mine!" As he says that the referee blows the whistle. the timeout is now over and the final possession is about to begin.
